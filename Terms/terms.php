        <p>You and Crowndidactic agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Crowndidactic arising in 
          connection with or relating in any way to these Agreements or to your relationship with Crowndidactic as a user 
          of the Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and 
          whether the claims arise during or after the termination of the Agreements) will be determined by mandatory binding 
          individual (not class) arbitration. You and Crowndidactic further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive 
          power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity 
          of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than 
          a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. 
          There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same 
          damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including 
          declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will
